# Message Board
A React Redux application that leverages the use of a simple [backend api](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) to show and interact with posts in different categories.

I experimented a little bit using redux-saga for the async actions.

## Local Development
Clone the backend api server linked above, and start it based on the instructions you find there.
To run locally, simply install packages with `yarn` and start the server:

```shell
yarn
yarn start
```

this should take you to your default browser with the application running!
